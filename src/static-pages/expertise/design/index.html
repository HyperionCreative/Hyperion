    <h2>UI/UX</h2>
    <p>While there are many factors at work behind the <strong>interfaces</strong> people love, we would sum it up as follows: a good <strong>interface</strong> is one that makes sense to the people using it. One that is adequate, beautiful, logical and empathetic towards the user. We also believe technology should be simple and improve people's lives in natural, almost invisible ways.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, we look at the whole picture and try to plan ahead as clearly as possible - when every detail has its place and purpose, <em>creativity and function come together naturally.</em></p>
