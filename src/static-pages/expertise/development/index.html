    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>For every <em>application, UI and UX</em> are just the tip of the iceberg; it's the <strong>code</strong> that breathes life into an app and makes everything tick. Because of this, <em>writing good code is of paramount importance</em> and we believe it comes down to this:</p>
    <p>Great code takes careful planning and requires an extensive knowledge of the tools at our disposal; it must be <em>well documented and modular, so that the product's structure is always clear</em>, and components can be <em>developed in a timely and cost efficient manner.</em> It must perform well across a wide range of devices and be well crafted. What's more, we do not limit ourselves by using templates or ready-made frameworks - <em>we build sites and apps</em> from the ground up, which affords us the freedom to not only create the <strong>great experience</strong> your users expect, but also ensure the <strong>project</strong> is flexible enough to not fall apart when new features are needed.</p>
