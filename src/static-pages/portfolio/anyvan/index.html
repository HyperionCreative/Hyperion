  <main>
    <p>Anyvan's organisational approach to providing on-demand cargo <strong>transport services</strong> is, in our opinion, deserving of all the awards it received and definitely a step in the right direction towards a cleaner, more efficient industry. By offering transport companies the opportunity to profit from the unused space in their trucks, they are not only reducing the number of unnecessary trips, but also benefiting customers who need a more affordable means of moving items across great distances.</p>
    <p>They decided to make their services more accessible by launching a <em>mobile app, for which we produced the interface, defined the experienced and worked closely with their development team to help implement it and shape the application.</em> The resulting product was a friendly, easy to use app that would make AnyVan's services even easier to benefit from.</p>
