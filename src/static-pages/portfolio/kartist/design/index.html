    <h1>Useful UI + Good Code</h1>
    <p>For this project we handled Kartist's <em>UI, coded the front end and created their browser extensions</em>. We wanted, as with most projects, to create something that will make sense to their target audience - an interface that is logically organised and effortless to use, but also beautiful. When coupled with good code, we are confident Kartist's experience will be an enjoyable one.</p>
    <p>The screen to the left demonstrates how users are prompted to sign up or login. Instead of using a more intrusive solution, we decided to gently nudge the logo every 5 seconds until the user hovers over it to learn where the sign up panel is. We believe this way, users are will not feel forced to sign up.</p>

    <h2>The Mobile Version</h2>
    <p>Kartist will not initially be developing native apps, so we had to make sure the mobile site was perfect.</p>
    <p>We tried to do more than create a diluted version of the desktop <strong>site</strong>, and instead strived to build a standalone <strong>experience</strong> that will make sense on mobile devices and be a pleasure to use, while affording users the same functions of the desktop site. We also aimed to stay true to the look and feel of the main site.</p>

    <h3>The Logo</h3>
    <p>For their logo, we worked with <strong>Alicja Murphy<strong> - a very talented Australian designer. Although we initially explored more abstract concepts, we decided a simple, yet expressive lettermark will be the most memorable choice, and will best represent what Kartist is about.</p>
