      <p>(Plain) Honesty. We care about the projects we get involved in and we are not going to be afraid to tell you when we think you’re wrong and there’s a better way. We are also not going to shy away from admitting if one of us is in the wrong; what ultimately matters is that a great and useful product results from our collaboration.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The Expertise. The primary focuses of our team are <strong>UI/UX, web design and development</strong>; We try to design and develop products that people can make sense of and will actually enjoy using. We want to get your message across in an elegant and efficient manner. More on this on the <a href="/expertise/design">Design Expertise Page</a> or on the <a href="/expertise/development">Development Expertise Page</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Fresh, Bold Ideas. While there is beauty in standardisation and similarity, and the product’s functionality should always be a core concern, we place equal value on experimentation and fresh, daring ideas.</p>
