    <p>While each project is unique, we do have established processes to ensure a clear direction is always established and understood.</p>

      <p><h2>Product Design. </h2>Building a successful <strong>app</strong> or <strong>site</strong> requires more than a great idea, <em>it requires careful planning and execution</em>. We're here to help with the latter two.</p>
      <p>We understand each <strong>project</strong> is unique so instead of jumping to the easiest solution, we are going to spend some time understanding who you are, what it is you are trying to achieve and who is the target market for your <strong>product</strong>. We will then ink out a basic structure for the product and start planning its execution.</p>
      <h3>From a front-end perspective, this usually involves defining the structure for each section or page, creating the designs and coding the interface up.</h3>
      <h3>As far as the back end is concerned, we will establish the logic early on, and <strong>develop the platform modularly</strong>.</h3>

      <p><h2>Redesign. </h2>In order to create something that actually works, we need to understand not only the issues your <strong>company</strong> is trying to overcome, but also <em>your objectives and the vision</em> the company was built on. Once we understand that, we will be well positioned to start planning: how to overcome your company's pain points and create <strong>a product that will efficiently serve your goals</strong>.</p>
      <p>After a plan is agreed on, we will get to the actual work, starting with the design stage - where we explore solutions and visual styles and define what the final product will look and feel like.</p>
      <he>We conclude the project with development, testing and finally, integration or deployment, as is the case.</he>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><h2>Consultation. </h2>For consulting <strong>projects</strong> we're lending <em>our ideas and expertise</em> to companies in need of either fresh, objective ideas or a professional's opinion. <em>Like product design or redesign projects</em>, we will start by understanding the whole picture and what it is you are trying to achieve. We will get to work and provide our assessment of the situation and the actions we believe will solve the problem.</p>
