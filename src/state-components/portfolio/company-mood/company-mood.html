                <p>We wanted to keep the first section simple and use it to greet the user, explain what the product is / why they should care, and give them a chance to either navigate the rest of the website or start learning how the product works.</p>

            <p>While the home page serves to introduce visitors to the product and convince them it is worthy of their time, we also created more detailed pages that explain Company Mood’s pricing model, their features or the company’s history, and we think this structure will give Company Mood’s visitors all the information they need to understand their product and sign up.</p>

              <h3 class="title">I. Getting started</h3>
              <p>We started this redesign project like most of our other projects, by getting to know the client, their business and the problems they are looking to solve. In this case, their goals were to redesign their website with a more professional and trustworthy look, all while restructuring it to better explains all the advantages their product can offer.</p>
              <p>To achieve this, we started with a series of conferences and questions.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--sub">II. Defining the structure</h3>
            <p>Once we had a clear picture of Company Mood’s message, we started exploring ways in which this information could be communicated to users and eventually defined the site’s structure.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--sub">III. getting the visuals right</h3>
            <p>With a structure in place, we moved on to the visual stage where we defined not only what each page should look like, but also what the identity of the site should reflect, what it should say to the people visiting it. Below are some of the images we looked at for the intro section.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--sub">IV. Developing the site</h3>
            <p>Since this is a static website, development started after the design was done. We made sure the site works well in all browsers and across all devices.</p>
